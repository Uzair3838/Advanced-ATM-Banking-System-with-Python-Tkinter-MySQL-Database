# Advanced-ATM-Banking-System-with-Python-Tkinter-MySQL-Database
📌 Project Description

This project is an Advanced ATM Banking System built using Python, featuring both:

✔ A Command-Line Interface (CLI)
✔ A Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter

Unlike simple ATM simulations that store data in variables or files, this project uses a MySQL database to store real account information such as:

Username

PIN

Balance

The system allows users to securely log in, check their balance, deposit money, withdraw funds, and update their login credentials.
An admin-like interface inside the GUI enables account creation, authentication, and real-time balance updates.
